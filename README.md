# Crop Yield Data India
## Overview
This repository contains a dataset detailing crop yields in India for the year 1997, including information on crop types, crop years, seasons, states, 
agricultural area, production quantities, annual rainfall, fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, and yield metrics.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. Crop: Name of the crop
2. Crop_Year: Year of crop cultivation
3. Season: Season during which the crop was cultivated (e.g., Kharif, Rabi)
4. State: Indian state where the crop was cultivated
5. Area: Area of land used for cultivation (in hectares)
6. Production: Quantity of crop produced (in units)
7. Annual_Rainfall: Annual rainfall during the cultivation period (in millimeters)
8. Fertilizer: Amount of fertilizer used (in kilograms per hectare)
9. Pesticide: Amount of pesticide used (in kilograms per hectare)
10. Yield: Crop yield metric (output per unit area)

## Learning Outcomes
This dataset is suitable for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks:

### Supervised Learning:
Predicting crop yield based on agricultural inputs and environmental factors.
Classification of crops based on their cultivation success.

### Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering states based on crop yield and agricultural practices.
Identifying patterns in crop production and environmental conditions.
